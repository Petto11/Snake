This project analyzes the efficiency and effectiveness of the DQN in solving the snake game. The baseline used is deterministic and completes the game every time, but it is slow and inefficient. Our solution is to find a faster and more efficient approach.

Inside the repo there are:

Basline.py: The baseline agent

Evaluate.py: File to run for reproducibility of results

Report.pdf: a file containing the report of the project

Snake_agent_train.py: The pipeline used to train our agent

environments_fully_observable: The environment used in the RL problem

snake_agent_2.pth: The weights of the trained agent
