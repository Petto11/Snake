This project analyzes the efficiency and effectiveness of the DQN in solving the snake game. The baseline used is deterministic and completes the game every time, but it is slow and inefficient. Our solution is to find a faster and more efficient approach.

Inside the repo there are:

The final report: a .PDF file showing how the analysis was carried out
Log: a .xes file containing the log of events
Python script: code for a part of the project. the rest of the analysis has been carried out using process mining softwares such as ProM and Woped.
